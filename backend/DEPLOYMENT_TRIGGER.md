# Backend Deployment Trigger

This file triggers the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the Spring Boot backend to aitechj-backend-v2.fly.dev.

## Issue
- Backend machines show "started" state but Spring Boot application not responding
- Health endpoint and root endpoint both timeout after 15+ seconds
- SSL handshake succeeds but application returns 0 bytes
- Signup functionality failing due to backend not serving HTTP requests

## Root Cause Analysis
- PR #42 successfully removed conflicting root-level frontend deployment files
- GitHub Actions deployment completed but Spring Boot may have startup issues
- Application not binding to 0.0.0.0:8080 or crashing during initialization

## Solution
- Trigger fresh GitHub Actions deployment workflow
- Ensure Spring Boot JAR builds and deploys correctly
- Verify application starts and binds to correct network interface
- Test health endpoint returns JSON response from Spring Boot
