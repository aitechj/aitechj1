# Backend Deployment Fix

This file triggers the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the Spring Boot backend to aitechj-backend-v2.fly.dev.

## Critical Issue Analysis
- Backend URL `https://aitechj-backend-v2.fly.dev` is serving Next.js frontend content instead of Spring Boot API
- Fly.io logs show Next.js 15.3.4 starting on port 3000, not Spring Boot on port 8080
- GitHub Actions deployments failing with "Error: Could not find App 'aitechj-backend-v2'"
- Root-level frontend deployment files (Dockerfile, docker-entrypoint.js, fly.toml) were re-added by PR #41 "New files from Fly.io Launch"

## Root Cause
PR #41 "New files from Fly.io Launch" re-added root-level frontend deployment files that conflict with backend deployment:
- Root-level Dockerfile: Next.js frontend (port 3000, Node.js)
- Root-level docker-entrypoint.js: Frontend startup script
- Root-level fly.toml: Frontend configuration missing Spring Boot environment variables

Despite PRs #42 and #43 removing these files, the backend deployment remains broken.

## Solution
- Ensure strict separation: Frontend ONLY on Vercel, Backend ONLY on Fly.io
- Remove any remaining root-level deployment conflicts
- Trigger fresh GitHub Actions deployment from ./backend directory
- Verify Spring Boot JAR builds and deploys correctly using backend/fly.toml configuration

## Expected Result
- Spring Boot application starts on port 8080 with proper health checks
- Backend responds to HTTP requests with JSON responses
- Signup functionality works without 503 errors
- Fly.io logs show Spring Boot startup messages instead of Next.js
