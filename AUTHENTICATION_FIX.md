# Authentication Fix Required

This file documents the authentication issue preventing Fly.io deployment.

## Issue
GitHub Actions deployment fails with:
```
Error: No access token available. Please login with 'flyctl auth login'
```

## Root Cause
Missing or invalid `FLY_API_TOKEN` in GitHub repository secrets.

## Solution Required
1. Generate new Fly.io API token: `fly auth token`
2. Add token to GitHub repository settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Set secret name as `FLY_API_TOKEN`

## Technical Status
✅ All code fixes implemented and merged (PRs #22-#27)
✅ Maven build step correctly configured in GitHub Actions workflow
✅ Deployment configuration properly set up
❌ Authentication token needs to be updated by repository owner

## Next Steps
After fixing the authentication token, push any change to main branch to trigger automated deployment.
